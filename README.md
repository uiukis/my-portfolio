# Hello, I am Wilker

## This is my portfolio :information_desk_person:
It's a work in progress project that I update and improve iteratively. At least, that's the plan!

### First things first
I would be happy if you pay my portfolio at [uiukis.netlify](http://uiukis.netlify.app/) a visit. Feel free to get in touch if you have feedback about it.

The portfolio was made in React. Take a look at other [projects](https://github.com/uiukis?tab=repositories) and get to know me a little more.

#### Uiukis-what?
*Uiukis* is a nickname given by friends. It's not very original, but it kind of worked.  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

#####Thanks for visiting! (づ￣ ³￣)づ
